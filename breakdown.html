			<p class="twoThridWidth">Why do we keep consuming content that makes us feel bad and why are these companies taking advantage of us?</p>
			<p class="twoThridWidth">What The Playground showed you was a dramatized version of what happens behind the scenes online. Companies want to sell you products and algorithms can push these products and ideas based on your interests and one of the best ways to sell is by creating and enforcing insecurities or hate.</p>

			<p class="twoThridWidth">Insecurites and hate are highly clicklable which is why Algorithms push them to you.</p>
			
			<p class="twoThridWidth">Algorithms pigeonhole you to one thing. This also allows people who already have a bias or belief to be reassured by people who only believe the same thing. </p>
			<p class="twoThridWidth">You shouldn’t just have one perspective.</p>

				<p>Algorithms create a personalized content feed which sounds great! But if you are constantly consuming media that is custom tailored to you, you become addicted to the scroll.</p>
				<p>Fear of missing out (FOMO) used to be about not hanging out with friends or missing an event. Now, we are seeing more and more people get FOMO because of being late to popular content or trends. Algorithms highlight what is popular constantly with new things popping up every day. It is hard to keep up unless you are constantly online.</p>
				<p>Almost everyone knows that any social media algorithm prioritizes content that is likely to generate high levels of engagement. This makes likes, shares, comments, views so addicting to get and makes you keep coming back for more.</p>

			<p id = "titleTwo" class="twoThirdWidth" data-aos="fade-up">Spread Of Misinformation</p>
			<p class="twoThridWidth">The echo chamber algorithms create allow for people to only be exposed to information that aligns with their beliefs and biases. The limit of exposure of different perspectives and beliefs, reinforces misinformation within the group of people with the same beliefs. </p>
			<p class="twoThridWidth">Algorithms know that people are more likely to engage with content that aligns with their interests and beliefs further promoting the same beliefs and biases. Algorithms don’t fact check before they push content which allows for misinformation to go unchecked. Clickbait titles are the fastest way to get people to view your content and algorithms reward content with higher visibility and engagement. Why be honest, when you can be famous. </p>
